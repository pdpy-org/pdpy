(# Connections
   
  # the example below prints the number 1234 to console
  -> 1234 > print
  # the following output also works
  # because connections work in reverse
  print < 'this works too' < loadbang

  #so, this is allowed
  -> 'bang' > print < 1 2 3 4 5 \foo \bar

  # NOTE: the '->' symbol is a synonym for 'loadbang >'
